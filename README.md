# PublicScripts

Hello there!


Welcome to my public repository!

This repository is intended to store the scripts created during my game development process in order to be shown to the general public.
The rest of project's assets are protected since the goal of this repository is to show my coding skills only!

Here you can find (following projects are listed ordered by their development start date, oldest to newest):
- U.F.O: Tank Hunter: https://simmer.io/@CaracowGames/u-f-o-tank-hunter (Play it in your browser!)
        "This was my first contact with the Unity 3D software. Here, I learnt the basics of Unity and C# programming. I learnt to manage 3D visuals, collisions, UI, sound effects, lighting, basic enemy AI..."
  
- Shoot Up!: A clone of the poorly known 1992 DOS game "Night Raid" (Work in progress...)
        "I focused on learning the basics of mobile game development by cloning an existing game. This allowed me to shift my attention away from designing game mechanics. I learned how to run a Unity game on an Android
        device. Additionally, I enhanced my code organization and cleanliness, enabling the implementation of more complex behaviors. For example, the AI of the enemies is designed to open fire on the soldier closest to
        their position. Also, the AI of the automatic turrets is designed to shoot the soldier closest to the ground. For this, I came up with the idea of implementing an "enemy scanner" object, which sweeps the screen
        from bottom to top several times per second. When this object collides with a soldier, that soldier becomes the turret's target."
  
- They Are Coming!: https://simmer.io/@CaracowGames/they-are-coming (Play it in your browser!)
        "In this project I focused on 2D visuals and animations. I mastered the management of 2D animations through code and to use events. This allowed me to create complex behaviors and mechanics. For example, the enemy
        called "Spitter", hides behind a metal trash can lid. However, the moment it reveals itself to attack is your opportunity to deliver a deadly headshot.
        Despite not being the main goal of developing this project, I learnt several game design skills by constantly trying to answer the question "Why is it still not fun to play?". As an example of this, I added obstacles
        that force the player to move, new types of enemies that drive the player to innovate their gameplay style to defeat them, or a health bar that decreases by time and replenishes with kills establishing 'killing' as
        the main goal in the game, and not just dodging."
  
- Extreme Clown Simulator: https://antonioestrad.itch.io/extreme-clown-simulator (Weekend game jam project)
        "It wasn't my first game jam, but it was the first where I took on the role of a programmer. In this experience, I worked alongside industry professionals from Axes In Motion and realised that I am ready to communicate
        effectively with my teammates and get the work done before the deadline."
